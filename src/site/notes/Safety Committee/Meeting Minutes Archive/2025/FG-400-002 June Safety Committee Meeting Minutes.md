7\. **New Topics/Concerns**

1. *Getting more BIPOC staff in the safety committee, additional incentives? Address concerns from staff regarding responsibility or workload.*  
2. *Need Safety Board in breakroom; minutes posted, current topics, names of members, anon paper report box*  
3. *Safety Onboarding rework? \-Cali referenced Haevyn for this task*  
4. *Severity of incident required reporting question; Quinn advised just submit all things and reevaluate as needed if too many “irrelevant” reports are submitted.*

***8\. Ask all present – Are you aware of any situation or condition in your work area that could result in someone getting injured?** If Yes, document and develop an Action Item to address the issue.  Include who is responsible to complete, what is to be done and the time frame for completion.*
