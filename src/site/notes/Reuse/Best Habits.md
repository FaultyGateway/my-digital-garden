>[!warning]+ Workspace best practices:
>- Check for screws on the worksurface; a loose screw can short out a motherboard and kill it.
>- Don't let the cable spaghetti monster live on your workspace! If you've been unintentionally braiding cables together, take a few mins to reset your space.
>- If you are losing track of what stage of progress you are on when working on multiple laptops, pair down the number you are working simultaneously on till you feel comfortable again.
>- Keep drinks out of arm/elbow reach so you don't accidentally knock it over.

>[!warning]+ Interns!
>- If you need to stop work on a device and come back to it at a later date, take notes and attach it to the laptop. You can use masking tape, sticky notes, or print out on receipt paper.

>[!tip] When opening a laptop, be sure to turn it over so the exposed side is facing the desk and give it a few taps to knock and loose screws or broken plastic bits out of the case. Check for screws stuck to the speaker grills, as they are magnetic.
