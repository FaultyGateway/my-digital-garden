If you plug in a Dell charger and the ring light goes off, there is likely some power delivery fault in the laptop itself, not the charger.
You can double check the chargers amps and try another charger but failing that, the laptop will get sent to be recycled/sold bulk.

>[!tip] When making changes to the BIOS, you can save time by hitting Apply, waiting till it greys out, and then hitting the power button on the laptop. After a second it will turn off completely and you dont have to wait on it to restart or hold down the power button to force it off. This can save time if you are just evaluating a laptop before putting a drive in it to proceed with final testing.
